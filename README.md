Gothia Open 12 website
======================

A website to handle registration of players, their results, and displaying all information. **Note that gothiaopen14 is a superset of this project, except for frontend stuff.**

The website is running for demonstrative purposes at [http://gopen.atwebpages.com](http://gopen.atwebpages.com). Note that this is not the server it originally ran at during the competition - some functionality may be lost. Using the contact form doesn't work, for example.
